This is a project for collecting, sorting and updating books in Luther College Sims library

Simmonds Library Project Plan Breakdown

Goal 1: Labels

**Note: I’m cleaning the Original Spreadsheets to make them all in consistent format and easy to read but I’ll have to recheck with the library if the ordering is correct**
**Additional Note: We will not send the Printing Labels spreadsheet until after Rechecking LCC for any additional reprinting labels**

-	First Step: Only focus on books that appear in Original Excel Files, and ignore all the other books.

-	Second Step: Among the books found in Original Excel Files, if they are unlabeled or unreadable, put them into a new 
Spreadsheet and send to the librarian for new labels.

-	Third Step (Second loop): Do the same for all books that appear in the ToAdd spreadsheet if they are shelved.

-	Fourth Step (Third loop): For any remaining books (considered as New book and need to be in a new spreadsheet if found).

Goal 2: Rechecking LCC

-	First Step: By reading through the Original Excel Files, ToAdd section, and New (if there any new books found in the library) spreadsheet, we note any additional LCC for the books into a new spreadsheet to be send to Professor Simmonds.

-	Second Step: From the Professor Simmonds’s selected LCC from the spreadsheet we send to him, if the selected LCC differs from the Printing Labels spreadsheet, we change the LCC of those books.

-	Third Step: If the selected LCC not in the Printing Labels spreadsheet, we add it into the Printing Labels spreadsheet.
